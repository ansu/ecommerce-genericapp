This layer is responsible for all things involving networking and external communication. That could be, as needed by pretty much any app these days, an HTTP client and a set of accompanying objects that do networking for the app and connect with the backend JSON API. Or it could be a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) client wrapper code that helps your app communicate and send or receive data from external Bluetooth devices. Or it could be a socket connec- tion code that allows your app to subscribe to server events and receive, let’s say, comments from another chat participant, or some other piece of data. Or it could be a location service that connects with a device’s GPS delegates and gets location change updates. You get the picture. The bottom line is that it’s the code that knows how to work with external interfaces, whether it’s HTTP or BLE or something else. Also quite often data serialization and mapping (let’s say from JSON to your custom objects) are included in this layer as well.

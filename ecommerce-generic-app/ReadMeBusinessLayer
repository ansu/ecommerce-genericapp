In this layer are objects that are responsible for the actual applicationâ€™s business logic, objects that use components of other layers to achieve results and do the work for the user. Coordinators that use HTTP service objects in conjunction with storages to orchestrate receiving data from backend APIs and persisting ittoCore Datawouldbeoneexample.
Another example of what goes into this layer could be a manager object that takes care of token encryption and saving to keychain using keychain storage and some kind of encryption service in it.
The main idea is that this layer helps us keep services, storages, and other layers decoupled from each other and tell them (aka orchestrate and coordinate) what to do to achieve results. This layer is what actually makes your application useful.

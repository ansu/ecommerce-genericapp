The UI layer is responsible for drawing things on the screen. This is all the stuff that naturally goes into that bucket like UIView subclasses, Autolayout, Table Views, Buttons, Collection Views, and Bar Buttons. Two other things that also belong to this layer that might not be obvious are View Controllers and View Models. View Controllers are suppose to do justthat,controltheview.View Modelsarecomplimentaryobjectsthathelp with decluttering and decoupling views from other layers of responsibility. Re- member the key to a happy and healthy iOS codebase is a skinny controller.
